<li>
These Terms of Service regulate your interaction with the Mech Warfware Registration web site, 
and our use of information that you give to us in relation to this website. By registering for 
a user name, or otherwise using the site, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
</li>
<li>
Mech Warfare Registration uses first-party cookies to store the logged-in state of your user 
account. The site will not work properly without cookies. Contrary to popular belief, the use 
of cookies is not, in itself, a privacy concern any more than your browsing history, your 
bookmarks, or the fact that you're using the internet in the first place.
</li>
<li>
You agree to only furnish truthful information to the site. This includes but is not limited 
to the email address, team composition, location, mech construction, payment information, and 
other data you enter in forms on the site. Whenever the site requests a "name," this name does 
not need to be the name of a person, but can be a fanciful moniker commonly associated with 
the person, team, or mech. However, you agree to not use a name that impinges on anyones 
copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property, and you agree not to use a name that 
would be misleading to a normal person or the operators of this site.
</li>
<li>
DMCA takedown process: The operators of the site do not screen or verify user-supplied 
information or content. If you feel that some user of the site is using the site in a manner 
inconsistent with your legal copyright, please contact us, giving the full identifying 
information of the content sufficient that we may isolate it, as well as a clear description 
if your copyright and how you believe this content infringes on it. Additionally, include 
full contact information for you, and for the legal owner of the copyright allegedly infringed.
We will then remove public access to the allegedly infringing content, and give the accused 
user the chance of counter-claiming or defending against the allegations in accordance with 
law and common best practice.
</li>
<li>
You agree to not use the site for solicitation, sales, or advertising not pre-approved by the 
operators of the site, nor anything not directly related to the sport of Mech Warfare. The 
presence of a web form that allows you to submit information does not constitute pre-approval 
for any kind of content you choose to post. Link baiting, astro-turfing, scamming, phishing, 
and SEO linking is explicitly forbidden on the site, and posting such content will make you 
liable under US and international law.
</li>
<li>
You agree not to use the site in any misleading, abusive, intrusive, or unlawful manner. If 
you have reason to believe another user is using the site in such a manner, you must immediately 
contact the site operator with sufficient information to identify and control such bad content. 
The determination of what constitutes misleading, abusive, or intrusive, is up to the site 
operator and any such decision is final.
</li>
<li>
We may from time to time change these terms of service, change the availability or functionality 
of the site, or change how we interpret these terms of service. Such change may not always be 
announced prior to going into effect. You agree to abide by any such future change, and your 
only recourse to any disagreement will be to cease using the site.
</li>
<li>
Limitation of liability and indemnification: You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the site 
operator from any and all claims made against the site operator related to your use of the site, 
be it permitted or not. In no event shall the site operator be liable for any monetary damages 
related to your use, or lack of ability to use, of the site, or any claim related to defamation, 
intellectual property infringement, or other injury.
</li>
<li>
The site does not sell user information to advertisers or mailing lists. However, the site will 
make information about users, teams, mechs, and events available to collaborators in order to 
operate the site. This includes but is not limited to making payment information available to 
payment providers, making registation information available to event organizers, and making team 
information available to team members. By using the site, you agree and consent to such 
information sharing. Additionally, we may share site information with government and courts of 
law who have proper legal authorization to demand such information. We may not always be able to 
share the fact that such sharing has taken place.
</li>
<li>
The site uses common best practices for information security. This includes hashing passwords 
with a strong irreversible hash function. Additionally, the site does not store direct payment 
information (such as credit card numbers,) instead using a trusted third party paymen provider 
for such information. Nevertheless, should a breach of site security happen, the site operator 
will not be liable for any indirect, special, consequential, immaterial, or personal damage. 
Such break may happen through cyber attack, third party provider malfeasance, government action, 
catastrophic failure, operational oversign, social engineering, or other unforseen methods.
Additionally, while the site allows you to choose any password of your choice, we recommend a 
long pass phrase that is hard to guess to protect your account.
</li>
<li>
In case of dispute, you agree to choice of venue being San Mateo count, California, USA, 
irregarding any conflict of jurisdiction. Additionally, you agree to settle any conflict with 
the site operator by arbitration, using an arbitrator certified in California and selected by 
the site operator, and you agree to bear the cost of such arbitration.
